# REPO.md

This is the repository governance document for `Avkroken/Docker-idempotent-update`. `Avkroken/.github/AGENTS.md` defines the shared organization-wide agent policy and defaults. This `REPO.md` defines the repository-specific requirements, technical contracts, invariants, validation rules, constraints, and operating instructions for this repository. Read both documents together. For matters specific to this repository, this document is authoritative unless live GitHub enforcement requires otherwise; the central defaults continue to apply where this document does not specialize them.

## Repository

This repository performs daily Docker maintenance inside a container: it pulls images, recreates changed containers, synchronizes backups through rclone and reports only when something actually happened.

### Technology and structure

- Python 3.13, Docker/Compose, rclone, msmtp and internal cron.
- `src/run.py` is the main job; Docker, backup, reporting and configuration logic live in separate modules under `src/`.
- Secrets come from environment variables; never hardcode credentials.
- The project normally relies only on the Python standard library.
- Unexpected failures may be reported best-effort through `src/github_report.py` when a token is configured; sensitive values must remain redacted.

### Versioning and validation

Avoid dependency pins unless they are needed. A necessary pin must document the reason and the condition for removal. GitHub Actions are the exception: pin third-party Actions to full commit SHAs and let Dependabot advance those immutable references.

For container changes, validate with Docker/Compose when practical in addition to the repository's relevant tests.

Repository workflows should remain small and single-purpose around Python CI, Docker/Trivy, OSV and package cleanup. Preserve the live check-context names when changing required workflows.

## `plex-clear-watchlist/`

This subtree deletes items from a Plex Watchlist through the Plex API and runs as a one-shot Docker container.

### Tech stack

- Python 3.14
- Plex API using `PLEX_TOKEN`
- Docker / Docker Compose

### Usage

```bash
PLEX_TOKEN=your-token docker compose run --rm plex-clear-watchlist --dry-run
PLEX_TOKEN=your-token docker compose run --rm plex-clear-watchlist
PLEX_TOKEN=your-token docker compose run --rm plex-clear-watchlist --limit 10
PLEX_TOKEN=your-token docker compose run --rm plex-clear-watchlist --keep 5
```

### Key files

```text
plex_clear_watchlist.py     # main script
requirements.txt            # Python dependencies
Dockerfile
docker-compose.yml
```

### Conventions

- `PLEX_TOKEN` is always supplied through the environment and is never hardcoded.
- `--dry-run` must remain side-effect free.
- Keep the script simple and single-purpose.

### Subtree branch rule

- Code changes for this subtree are handed over on `dev`, with the change proposal opened from `dev` to the repository default branch.
- Do not start a new code task while a proposal from `dev` remains open; finish or close it first.
- Open proposals ready for review, not as drafts.
- Keep each proposal limited to one task and require its tests to pass.
- Never force-push, delete branches, disable workflows or modify GitHub organization settings as part of this subtree flow.
